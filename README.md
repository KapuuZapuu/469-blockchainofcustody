# Description of Project

The chain of custody project centers around the creation of 2 classes, a blockchain class and a block class. Because the blocks may be difficult to create, we decided to build a class around it that allowed an easy and repeatable way to create blocks, pack and unpack blocks, and create any functions regarding a specific block. Then, it was a very simple extension in logic to create a manager, or handler, for the blocks which we called BlockChain. This class manages all the interactability with the blocks. It manages the list, it implements features such as add or remove, checkout or checkin, or assurance functions like show history or verify. This is the approach that made the most sense given the project requirements.
